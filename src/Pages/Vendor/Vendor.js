          <h2>Step 1: Review Terms and Condition</h2>
          <p>Take the time to carefully read and understand the terms and conditions outlined for vendors on SmartWave. This foundational step ensures that you operate within the guidelines set by the platform.</p>
        </div>

        <div className='steps'>
          <h2>Step 2: Product Approval Process</h2>
          <p>After understanding the T&C's, initiate the product approval process by providing details of the product you intend to publish on SmartWave. This step is vital for the vetting process, ensuring that vendors only list products for which they hold original equity and resale rights.</p> <br></br><br></br>
          <p>The following details are required for vetting and approval:</p> <br></br>
          <p><strong>Product URL:</strong> A sales page is essential for listing your product. If needed, consider hiring a skilled copywriter to create an impactful sales copy.</p> <br></br><br></br>
          <p><strong>Product Delivery Process:</strong> SmartWave evaluates the ease of your product delivery process and validates the overall quality of the product.</p> <br></br><br></br>
          <p><strong>Commission Offer:</strong> Specify the commission percentage you intend to pay affiliates for each product sale. Affiliates are likely to opt for products with more favorable commission rates</p> <br></br><br></br>
          <p><strong>Customer Support Information:</strong> Provide information on the accessibility of your business and how customers can quickly contact support in case of any issues with your product.</p> <br></br><br></br>
          <p>Submit these details to support@smartwave.ng, using the subject line - Request for New Vendor Application.</p> 
        </div>

        <div className='steps'>
          <h2>Step 3: Product Approval and Registration Fee</h2>
          <p>Once your product is approved, you will be required to send in the necessary links to successfully list your product. Note that there is a vendor registration fee of $30.00 or N25, 000 per annum for each product. This fee is subject to change and is non-refundable. After approval, you will receive a registration link to sign up as a vendor.</p> <br></br><br></br>
          <p>For Registered Vendors:</p> <br></br>
          <p>If you already have a vendor account registered with SmartWave, follow the same process as outlined above. Provide the necessary details of the products you wish to list for approval by sending an email to support@smartwave.ng with the subject line - Request for New Vendor Application.</p> <br></br><br></br>
          <p><strong>Platform Fees:</strong> SmartWave charges a 10% fee on each product sold on the platform. This fee is automatically deducted from the selling price of your product.</p> <br></br><br></br>
          <p><strong>Refund Policy:</strong> Products owned by vendors on the SmartWave platform must have a refund policy.</p> <br></br><br></br>
          <p><strong>Withdrawals:</strong> Vendor withdrawals on the SmartWave platform are processed every Friday after verification by our team, with payments scheduled for Saturdays.</p> <br></br><br></br>
